        </h1> Strategy Consultant
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Amrit Johal, as stated above and I am originally from the Bay Area. I was born and raised in Fremont, CA before coming to Riverside, CA for college. I am a student of UC Riverside and have been looking for internship opportunities in the field of information systems or marketing. I am currently enrolled in the Pre-Business program and have had multiple interviews at different companies. I have also interned at a non-profit organization in Mission San Jose High School located in Fremont, CA. <br><br>

        I am interested in an Internship because despite concentrating in Information Systems, I plan on pursuing a marketing career in the future. Growing up, I was always fascinated by psychology, and for a time I thought I would become a psychiatrist. However, in high school I joined DECA, a competition-based business club, and I realized that I wanted to pursue business. In DECA, I learned a lot about different business aspects and how to fundraise, increase student engagement, and most importantly mentor underclassmen with their business plans. I had a lot of fun competing in regionals and state competitions mostly with marketing campaigns. I think marketing specifically appeals to many of my interests because it blends creativity, behavioral psychology, and competition. As I pursue a degree in Information Systems, I want to still gain experience and connections within the marketing field and I believe an internship will help me do so. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed the guest speakers and socials so far as a business student and I know it is something Iâ€™d like to be a part of. I enjoy taking responsibility and leadership especially when it is something I am genuinely passionate about, which is why I think being an intern would be really beneficial to me. <br><br>

        I have experience in volunteering for a Free Medical Hospital, coding camps, and for the American Cancer Society. In high school, other than DECA, I was treasurer of the MSJ History Club, Activities Coordinator of MSJ SportsHi, and was also a Team Captain for MSJ Relay for Life. For extracurricular activities, I also did sports. I was in track for two years and soccer for 3. I was captain of JV as a freshman and was then in Varsity. I really enjoyed taking a leadership role in sports because it is highly motivating and so much fun to really work well with others as a team. I think everyone should try out being in a leadership role as a young adult because you learn so much about the world around you and how to deal with others. You also learn how to deal with yourself in terms of disappointment and stress. In terms of work experience, I have had two jobs, one at my local waterpark Aqua Adventures as a party host and the other as a soccer coach for little kids.
